      <p>Galaxies are systems consisting of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust, that are all bound together by gravity. They come in a variety of different shapes (such as ellipticals, spirals, and irregular) and sizes, with larger galaxies said to contain a trillion stars and span more than a million light-years across, and smaller galaxies said to contain a thousand stars and span only a few hundred light-years. Most galaxies are between 10 billion - 13.6 billion years old, with some being almost as old as the universe's formation (3.8 billion years ago). Galaxies can organise themselves into groups of 100 or fewer galaxies, which are then held together by their mutual gravity. These are called clusters, with larger ones said to hold up to 1000 galaxies. These groups and clusters can arrange themselves into superclusters, which are not gravitationally bound and assist in making up the structure of the cosmic matter in our universe.

      Earth is located inside the Milky Way Galaxy, a spiral galaxy that contains a disc of thousands of stars that span across 100 million light-years. Our planet is located around halfway from the centre, around one of the galaxy's spiral arms. From where we are on Earth, the galaxy looks like a faint, milky band of light arcing across the sky (hence the name "Milky Way"). The Milky Way sits in a neighbourhood called the Local Group, which contains 50 other galaxies ranging from dwarfs (few billion stars) to Andromeda Galaxy, our closest Galactic neighbour, located around 179 million light-years away.</p>
