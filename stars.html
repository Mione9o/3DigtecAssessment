      <p>Stars are the most widely recognised astronomical matter in space. They are responsible for the creation and distribution of a number of elements, such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The study of a star's life cycle is also one of the most essential topics to learn within the field of astronomy. 
      <br><br>
        Stars are formed inside dust clouds through turbulence, which gives rise to knots containing a large enough mass of gas and dust to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. This heats up the material at the centre, giving birth to a protostar. This protostar is the heart of the core, and will one day become a star. Once the star is formed, it will remain for many centuries until all the hydrogen has fused in its core. When that happens, the nuclear reactions in the core cease, and the star will begin to collapse in on itself. This pushes the outer layers of star, which expands and cools to transform into a red giant. What happens next depends on the type of star, as they each have a different fate in store for them.</p>

    <h2 class="constellation_title">Be A Constellation!</h2>
    <p>Constellations are a group of celestial bodies (stars) that form a shape/pattern in space and given a name. These stars may seem close to one another, but in reality, they may actually be far away from one another. Each can be seen throughout different times of the year and at different heights depending on where you live. This is due to the Earth's orbit around the sun, as the night sky will change as the Earth rotates. This means that you won't be able to see every constellation at the same time, and, depending on where you live, you might not be able to see them all no matter what time of the year it is.
    <br><br>
    Many cultures have different names and numbers of constellations depending on what they people may believe/see, but today, there are 88 officially recognised constellations. In New Zealand, one of the most recognisable constellations are Matariki, which has its own public holiday. In Māori tradition, Matariki represents the start of the Māori New Year, a time for those to remember the past, celebrate the present, and look to the future. At this time, families come together to reconnect with each other, honour their ancestors through ritual fires and offerings, and celebrate the lives they have. Other well known constellations are the ones that make up the zodiac signs, which represent the different birthdate times depending on their appearance and is often associated with personality traits. You can see images of these constellations in the image loop below this section, ordered from Aries (Ram) to Pisces (Fish).
