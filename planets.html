      <p>The meaning of the term "planet" has been a topic of debate that has continued to evolve over the years. In ancient times, Planet was a term used by the Greeks (derived from the Greek word "Planetes", meaning "wanderer") to describe objects that moved in relation to fixed, background stars and were visible to the naked eye. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) voted to change the definition of the term "planet". Planets are now defined as objects that orbit the sun, are round (or nearly round) due to gravity, and "clear the neighbourhood" around its orbit.

      Today, there are currently 8 objects in space that are defined as planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Earth is the planet we live on, comprised of rocks and oceans and the only known planet that is able to inhabit life. Three of these planets are also "rocky" and have similar characteristics to Earth, such as Mercury's internally generated magnetic fields, Venus' active volcanoes and Mars' liquid water beneath its surface. However, the other four planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) have been found to be large planets mainly composed of Helium and Hydrogen, earning them the name "Gas Giants". These planets help make up the Solar System, the gravitationally bound system of objects that orbit around the sun.</p>
